Spent the morning setting up a basic REST API in Node.js with Express.

It's pretty standard stuff, but good to have a backend to connect to.

Thinking about using MongoDB as the database.

Will get started on connecting to the Vue frontend.

The API endpoint is returning data correctly!

Connected Vue to the API.

Worked on styling the Vue application using Bootstrap.
