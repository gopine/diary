Investigated GraphQL as an alternative to REST.

Fetching only the necessary data seems very efficient.

Considering switching our API architecture.

Need to evaluate the learning curve.

GraphQL's schema definition is powerful.

Played around with Apollo Client.

Learned about Docker for containerization.

It simplifies deployment and ensures consistency.

Trying to integrate it into our CI/CD pipeline.

This should resolve the "works on my machine" problem.

Dockerfiles can be surprisingly complex.

Experimented with Docker Compose.

Explored Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

Offline capabilities and push notifications are compelling.

Considering making our website a PWA.

The service worker API looks interesting.
