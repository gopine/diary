Today was dedicated to understanding Kubernetes.

The world of container orchestration is complex.

Trying to wrap my head around pods, deployments, and services.

Need to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for experimentation.

Setup Minikube for local Kubernetes development.

Looking into service meshes like Istio.

The ability to manage microservices traffic and security is crucial.

It integrates with Kubernetes.

Learning about the different features like traffic routing and fault injection.

Deployed a simple service mesh to Minikube.

Experimented with fault injection using Istio.
