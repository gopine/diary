"Looking into GraphQL today.

A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools."

"Trying to use GraphQL."

"Found some useful tutorials on GraphQL."

"Spent the morning exploring serverless databases like FaunaDB.

The idea of a database that scales automatically without server management is appealing.

Trying to connect FaunaDB to a serverless function.

Learning about GraphQL integration with FaunaDB."

"FaunaDB seems a little complex at first glance."
