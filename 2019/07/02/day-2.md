It seems like a great way to build scalable microservices.

The initial setup was a bit tricky, but the documentation is pretty helpful.

Successfully deployed a "Hello, World!" function.

Debugging CORS issues, as always.

Delved deeper into React Hooks, specifically useState and useEffect.

They offer a cleaner way to manage state and side effects in functional components.

Still wrapping my head around avoiding infinite loops in useEffect.
