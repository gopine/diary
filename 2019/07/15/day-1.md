Started prototyping the microfrontend architecture using Webpack Module Federation.

It allows sharing code between different applications at runtime.

The initial setup was quite involved.

Successfully loaded a remote module!

Continued working on the microfrontend prototype, adding communication between the different microfrontends.

Exploring different communication patterns.

Event bus seems like a viable option.
