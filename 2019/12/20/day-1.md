Spent the morning diving deeper into React hooks.

useState and useEffect are becoming clearer.

Planning to refactor an old component to use hooks instead of classes.

Hopefully, this will improve code readability.

Finally got the React component refactored and working.

Learned about Context API for managing global state in React.

Working on optimizing website performance today.

Focused on image optimization and code minification.

Initial tests show promising results.

Experimented with different image compression algorithms.

Successfully reduced page load time by 15%.
