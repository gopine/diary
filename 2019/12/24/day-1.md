Back to work.

Working on a new feature for our web application.

Implemented a user profile page with editable fields.

Integrated Formik library to handle form validation.

Unit tests for new form complete.

Debugging a strange bug in the payment processing module.

It only occurs on certain browsers.

This is quite frustrating.
