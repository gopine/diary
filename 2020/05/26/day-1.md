Started exploring serverless functions with AWS Lambda.

The initial setup felt a bit complex.

I deployed a simple "Hello, World!" function using Node.js.

Hoping this will streamline some upcoming projects.

Debugging the serverless function was surprisingly straightforward using CloudWatch logs.

Understanding the dependency array is crucial to avoid infinite loops.

I refactored a component to use `useReducer` for complex state management.
