Spent the morning learning about Next.js for server-side rendering.

The framework simplifies building React applications with SSR.

Created a simple Next.js application with a few pages.

It is easy.

Next.js's file-based routing is very convenient.

Configuring Next.js to fetch data from an external API.

Investigated using Storybook for developing and documenting React components.

The isolation and visual testing are very helpful.

Created a few stories for a simple button component.

Documenting will be very easy.

Storybook's add-ons provide a lot of useful functionality.

Publishing my Storybook to Netlify for easy access.

Started learning about gRPC as an alternative to REST for microservices communication.

The performance benefits of binary serialization are attractive.

Set up a simple gRPC server and client using Node.js.
