Working on improving our continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

Automating the testing and deployment process.

Using Docker to containerize our applications.

Integrating our pipeline with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

Configured Docker for a project.

Connected CI/CD pipeline to Azure Container Registry.

Started exploring React Hooks today.

The `useState` hook seems really useful for managing component state.

Need to dive deeper into `useEffect` for side effects.
