Started learning about serverless functions on AWS Lambda.

The promise of scaling without managing servers is very appealing.

I experimented with a simple Node.js function.

Debugging feels different without traditional servers.

I think serverless is the future.

Deployment is very easy though.

Dived deeper into React hooks.

`useState` and `useEffect` are becoming second nature.

I built a small component to fetch data from an API.

Still struggling with managing complex state.

The React ecosystem is ever-changing.

Context API seems powerful for sharing state.

Explored GraphQL as an alternative to REST.

The idea of fetching only the data I need is attractive.

Set up a basic Apollo Client on the frontend.
