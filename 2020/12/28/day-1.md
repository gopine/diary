Started experimenting with Remix as a full-stack web framework built on web standards.

The focus on web fundamentals is refreshing.

The server-side rendering and data loading are well designed.

It's a strong alternative to Next.js.

Web standards are key to the web.

Remix is a promising framework.

Started using TypeScript to add static typing to my JavaScript projects.

The initial setup was straightforward.

I added type annotations to a React component.

It feels like it will catch errors earlier.

Typescript catches issues during compile time.

TypeScript improves code quality.

Explored the use of Serverless Functions for building backend APIs.

Deployed a function to AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.
