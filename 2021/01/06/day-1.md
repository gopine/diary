Diving into TypeScript to improve code maintainability.

The type system feels a bit strict at first.

Hopefully, it will catch errors early on.

Going through some online tutorials and documentation.

Configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.

Integrated TypeScript with my existing React project.

Spent the morning learning about GraphQL.
