The Serverless architecture is gaining traction.

I need to understand the benefits and drawbacks.

AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions are popular options.

Security and cold starts are important considerations.

Deployed a simple function to AWS Lambda.

Configured API Gateway to trigger my Lambda function.

WebAssembly (Wasm) is enabling near-native performance in the browser.

I need to learn how to compile code to Wasm.

Integrating Wasm modules into JavaScript applications.

This could be useful for computationally intensive tasks.

Compiled a C program to WebAssembly using Emscripten.
