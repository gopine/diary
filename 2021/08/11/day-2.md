Class fields, top-level await, and error cause are interesting additions.

JavaScript evolves very quickly.

Experimented with class fields in a JavaScript project.

Used top-level await in a Node.js application.

Studying about the new CSS features like container queries.

Container queries should help to make responsive design even easier.

Looking forward to using container queries.

Experimented with container queries in a web project.
