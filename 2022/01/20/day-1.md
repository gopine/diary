Implemented a simple chat application using WebSockets and Node.js.

It was a great learning experience to understand real-time communication.

I also explored different WebSocket libraries for Node.js.

Now need to secure the WebSocket connection with TLS.

Integrated the chat application with the existing user authentication system.

Debugged an issue with the WebSocket connection dropping intermittently.

Improved the error handling in the chat application.

Worked on improving the performance of the website by optimizing images.
