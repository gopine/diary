Today I am working on implementing monitoring and alerting for the application.

I am using Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics.

This will help to detect and resolve issues quickly.

Installed Prometheus and configured it to collect metrics.

Created a Grafana dashboard to visualize the metrics.

Set up alerts to be notified of critical issues.

I am learning more about WebAssembly (Wasm).

I am exploring how to run code written in other languages in the browser.

Wasm opens up new possibilities for web development.

I will use it for video editing.

Installed the WebAssembly toolchain.

Compiled a C program to WebAssembly.

Loaded the WebAssembly module in the browser.

Today I am exploring blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps).

I am learning about smart contracts and how they can be used to build secure and transparent applications.

DeFi is very interesting topic.

Set up a local Ethereum development environment.

Wrote a simple smart contract in Solidity.

Deployed the smart contract to the local Ethereum network.
