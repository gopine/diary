I am studying about Federated Learning.

Privacy and security is very important and Federated learning solves a very common problem.

I will be focusing on image processing.

Setup a local environment for federated learning.

Implemented secure aggregation for federated learning.

Today I am exploring WebGPU.

This new API will allow to do high performance graphics and computations on the web.
