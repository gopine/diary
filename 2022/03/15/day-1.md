I am working on a new project with Svelte.

Svelte is a compiler that transforms your components into highly efficient imperative code that surgically updates the DOM.

The syntax looks very simple.

Created a new Svelte project.

Created a component.

Added a store for state management.

Today I am looking more into Flutter.
