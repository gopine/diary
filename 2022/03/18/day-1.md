I am trying to build desktop applications with Tauri.

Tauri apps are smaller and more secure.

It allows to build applications with Rust and web technologies.

The frontend can be written in any framework.

Installed Tauri.

Created a Tauri project with React.

Added a backend written in Rust.

I want to learn more about RedwoodJS.
