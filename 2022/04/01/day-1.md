I am exploring the world of web3.

I would like to build a simple app that communicates with the blockchain.

I also need to learn about different web3 authentication strategies.

Started exploring backend options.

Considering Node.js with Express for the API.

It seems like a good fit for a JavaScript-centric stack.

Setting up the server and basic routes was relatively straightforward.
