Started exploring the new ES2022 features, particularly class static initialization blocks.

Looks like a cleaner way to manage class setup.

Also digging into the latest performance improvements in V8.

Hoping to see these reflected in our app's load times.

Considering integrating Top-Level Await in some of our build scripts.

Initial tests with static initialization blocks are promising.
