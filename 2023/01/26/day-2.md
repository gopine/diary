I implemented code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense.

It dramatically reduced the initial load time.

The app feels much snappier now.

Experimented with different image optimization techniques.

Updated the documentation with the new features.

Reviewed the changes with the team.

Started working on internationalization (i18n).

I'm using the `i18next` library.
