Faced a challenging bug related to state management in React.

After hours of debugging, I discovered a subtle race condition.

It only occurred under specific circumstances.

I resolved it by using a callback-based approach to update the state safely.

Researched best practices for managing complex state in React.

Discussed alternative state management solutions with team.

Started planning the next sprint with the team.
