Started working on migrating our legacy jQuery codebase to React.

It's a massive undertaking, but the benefits of componentization and virtual DOM are undeniable.

Hoping to improve performance and maintainability significantly.

The initial setup and configuration took longer than expected, dealing with Webpack configurations and Babel presets.

Managed to get a basic component rendering.

Still struggling with some of the older jQuery plugins.

Continued the React migration, focusing on a smaller, self-contained module.

Implemented a basic data fetching component using `useEffect` hook and `fetch` API.

Encountered a few CORS issues, resolved by updating the server-side headers.

Learning a lot about functional components and the React lifecycle.

Successfully refactored the module.

Started documenting the migration process.
