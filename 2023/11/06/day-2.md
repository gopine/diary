Diving into the world of Deno Deploy.

I'm curious how it stacks up against Netlify and Vercel.

The global distribution is attractive, and the pricing seems competitive.

I'm going to deploy a small API endpoint to test it out.

The goal is to move some of backend services to Deno Deploy in the future.
