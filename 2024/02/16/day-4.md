It seems like the code is a lot cleaner and more readable.

Need to convert most of the existing code to the new syntax.

I wonder how this syntax will work with Typescript.

Converted multiple code snippets to use pipe operators.

Started using biome for linting and formatting.

It seems a lot faster than the other linters.

Need to switch all the configuration over.
