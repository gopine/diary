I am trying to migrate an old project to use the server components to see how well it works.

Performance is noticeably better on initial load.

Debugging a weird issue where the state is not updating correctly in a deeply nested component.

Finally found the issue; it was a stale closure.

Spent the morning setting up a Next.js project with Turbopack.

The build times are significantly faster than Webpack.

I'm looking into migrating the other projects to Turbopack as well.

The initial setup was surprisingly straightforward.
