Delved into the world of WASM and Rust for a performance-critical section of the website.

The initial learning curve is steep, but the performance gains are promising.

I am planning to integrate it with the existing Javascript codebase.

The tooling seems pretty robust too.

Managed to compile a simple Rust function to WASM and use it in Javascript.
