Focused on learning more about GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates.

They provide a scalable alternative to polling.

Server-sent events are another common alternative.

This is a practical solution for many scenarios.

These systems require solid architectural implementation.

Created a simple REST API using Node.js and Express.js.

Debugged an issue related to JavaScript event handling in a web page.

I'm trying to get better at using TypeScript in my projects.

It helps me to catch more issues.
