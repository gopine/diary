Started exploring Web Components for a more modular approach to front-end development.

The shadow DOM seems promising for encapsulation.

Thinking about how this could improve our current project's maintainability.

Initial impressions are positive, but need to delve deeper.

Managed to get a simple Web Component working, the learning curve isn't too steep so far.

Considering using LitElement as a library to ease Web Component creation.

Spent some time today looking at different state management libraries.

Redux seems a bit overkill for our current needs.

Maybe something lighter like Zustand or Jotai would be a better fit.

Need to evaluate them based on bundle size and ease of use.
