Reviewed the code of my collegue for an unrelated task.

Explored different options for deploying containerized applications.

Practiced setting up new workflow in Github Actions for better control.

Started exploring the new CSS container queries.

They seem like a game-changer for responsive design.

I think it could simplify some of my media query logic.

Need to try it out on a real project.

This would be a really good implementation.
