Experimenting with WebAssembly for a performance-critical module.

Trying to implement a computationally intensive algorithm in Rust and compile it to WebAssembly.

The initial results are promising, but there's still a lot of work to be done.

WebAssembly integration is proving to be challenging.

Made some progress on the WebAssembly module.

Back to the GraphQL implementation.

Need to handle error cases and implement proper data validation.

Also, lots of meetings today.

Stuck in a meeting.

Implemented basic error handling for the GraphQL API.
