Started refactoring some legacy JavaScript code to use ES modules.

It's long overdue.

The codebase will be much more maintainable.

Hopefully, it won't break everything.

Fixed a few bugs after migrating to ES modules.

Refactoring is going well.

Looking into accessibility best practices.

ARIA attributes are important.

Need to ensure our website is usable for everyone.

Testing with screen readers is essential.
