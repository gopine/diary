Started using Typescript in a new project.

Spent some time configuring the tsconfig.json file.

Really appreciate the type safety it provides.

Still getting used to the syntax and advanced types.

Struggling with the different types of Typescript.

Need to understand generic types more clearly.

Exploring the concepts of GraphQL and Apollo Client.

Setting up a simple GraphQL server using Node.js and Express.

The schema definition language seems relatively straightforward.

Looking forward to using it in a real-world project.

Created my first schema for GraphQL server.

Start using Apollo client to query data from server.
