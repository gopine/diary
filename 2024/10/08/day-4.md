Spent time debugging a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issue.

It's always a pain to deal with.

The browser security is pretty strict.

Finally solved it by configuring the server to send the correct headers.

Finally got the CORS issues sorted out.

Documenting the CORS configuration.

Exploring the possibilities of integrating WebAssembly into our project.

It could potentially improve performance for computationally intensive tasks.

Need to find a good use case for it.

Maybe image processing or physics simulations.
