Dived into Serverless functions on AWS Lambda.

It seems like a great way to build scalable and cost-effective microservices.

I deployed a simple "Hello, World!" function to Lambda using the AWS CLI.

The serverless function is deployed.

Experimenting with different serverless architectures.

Researched different approaches to improve website accessibility.

Implemented ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to enhance the experience for users with disabilities.

Tested with screen readers to identify and fix any issues.

Testing websites for accessibility is hard.
