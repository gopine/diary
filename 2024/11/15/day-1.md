Spent time learning about Web Components and Shadow DOM.

The idea of creating reusable and encapsulated UI elements is powerful.

Built a simple custom element to display a styled button.

Web component is working fine.

Learned more about shadow DOM.

Explored the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and service workers.
