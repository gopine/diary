Started playing around with HTMX today.

It seems like a cool way to build dynamic UIs without a ton of JavaScript.

I'm thinking about using it for a small side project.

The simplicity is definitely appealing after dealing with complex frameworks.

HTMX might be the future of web development!

I think it's going to be fun.

Back to work today.

Spent the morning in meetings.

Thinking about how to apply some of the serverless concepts to our existing infrastructure.

Meetings are too long.

Need more time to code.

We should use serverless.

Investigating Deno Deploy for serverless functions.

Seems simpler than AWS Lambda and potentially faster.

The TypeScript support is a big plus.

Need to do some benchmarking to compare performance.

Deno deploy sounds promising.

Trying to use it on pet projects.
