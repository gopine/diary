Started exploring WebAssembly for improved web app performance.

It seems like a promising technology for handling complex calculations client-side.

I'm particularly interested in its potential for speeding up image processing tasks in the browser.

Need to dive deeper into the tooling and ecosystem around WASM.

Hope it can reduce server load for the team.

Investigated different WASM compilers; Emscripten seems like a good starting point.

Got a basic WASM module running in a React component.

Spent time learning more about serverless functions.

It appears that everyone is adopting serverless with different cloud providers like AWS lambda, Azure Functions and GCP.

I'm looking into using them for processing user uploads.

Hoping this helps with the scalability of the team's services.

It is important to reduce operational overhead.
