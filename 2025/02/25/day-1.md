Today, I shifted focus to enhancing the website's performance and security.

I started by integrating lazy loading for images and optimizing JavaScript delivery to improve load times.

I also experimented with service workers to enable offline caching, drawing inspiration from Progressive Web App (PWA) techniques.

This should create a smoother experience for users, even in low-connectivity scenarios.

On the security front, I reviewed our current protocols and applied updates to HTTP security headers, aiming to bolster defenses against common vulnerabilities.
