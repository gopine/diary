Today I finally grasped the concept of Merkle trees and their importance in blockchain data verification.

It's fascinating how they efficiently summarize large datasets.

Now, I'm eager to explore how they are implemented in specific blockchain platforms.

I plan to dive deeper into the code tomorrow.

Finally dove into understanding Solana's program model today.

The concept of accounts and programs as stateful and stateless entities, respectively, is becoming clearer.

Still struggling a bit with the CPI calls, but I'm making progress.

Thinking about building a simple token contract to really solidify my understanding.

Need to spend more time with the Anchor framework docs.

Today was a deep dive into Solana's program deployment process.
